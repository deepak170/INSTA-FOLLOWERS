### Markdown
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Varela+Round" rel="stylesheet"> I just started CPA AND YOUTUBE METHOD AND SEEING SMALL RESULT BUT THE PROBLEM NOW IS THAT THE YOUTUBE BANS OR SUSPENDS MY VIDEOS.

Now, wish to try different strategy, of course leveraging the possible suggestions from this helpful forum.

My goal:
to upload as many videos as i can, i believe to be successful doing this method, more videos should be uploaded, so it is a numbers games.

My question:
Please, what if i upload the similar video but changing either the background sound, or the thumbnail, or add few words towards the end using my video editing software, would it help to make it look different video in the eyes of YouTube?
