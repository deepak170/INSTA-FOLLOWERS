# How to Rank on Google page 1 on 4 days


hello everyone, I have to say that I've been pretty successful at bypassing Google's Algorithm and getting sites to meet their ranking criteria to the tee. To show you a sample, tomorrow I'm going to take a domain I have that has never had a site on it, build the site and get it on the first page of Google within 4 days for its keyword. Stay up to date and watch how I do it, it's always fun teaching Google a lesson :)

Hello and thanks to everyone reading this and to those following. As mentioned below and I'll mention it again, I will be posting updates regularly and will have the site up later today. Just wanted to point out a couple of things I think everyone should know about even though a good majority of you are already aware of it, just wanting to emphasize on it. Google just made an Algorithm update which was mainly geared towards EMD's and sites with low quality content. It effects a few other things as well but that was mainly it for the most part. Though, I'm going to offer everyone a few tips below that you MUST follow now to either maintain your ranking before you lose it, or, to get back the ranking that you lost:

## No more spun or copied content

The new Google Algorithm update is much more on top of things now and they are taking content very seriously. Research and then write your own content (Or hire someone). Unique and quality content is a must and can't tell you how important this now is. 

## Have a Good Link Diversity

Having low quality links coming to your site or low quality links coming to your linked sites can raise a red flag. They are not reviewing second tier incoming links which means if the site linking to you has low quality links, the impact on your site will be much greater now then it was before.

## Social Media Links

Have they always been important? Yes. Are they more important now? Yes! SEO is moving up a notch in many aspects and believe it or not, your site can be penalized from having "NO" Social Media back links. Though you may not see a significant drop in ranking(s) from no Social Media links, they consider sites that have links from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to be more diverse in their online presence and ultimately consider them to have a higher level of reputability,

Stay up to date everyone, there's a lot more updates coming soon! :)

***Update***

Working on the site today and will post as soon as I have it up. I wanted to answer a question I received here on one of the comments.

How can I keep it in the position once I rank it?

Because I know how to! But seriously let me explain. My intentions are to share my method(s) with everyone here as I'm not greedy enough to with hold all of my tactics as many have mentioned that I should until it's saturated. There's plenty of niches to target and plenty of money online to go around! Attaining and maintaining a sites ranking is easy if you know how to and is obviously very difficult if you don't. With each update I make will be a descriptive step by step guide (Blueprint) as to how to rank your site and keep it there and this is post Panda and recent EMD update fool proof that is guaranteed to work. This is a plan that I've personally put into place and is a plan I devised myself. So, with that said, just stay tuned and watch out for updates.
